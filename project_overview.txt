💻 CrowdFundNext – Technical Overview

🧠 Overview
CrowdFundNext is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with Firebase Authentication, deployed via Docker Compose. It is structured for scalability, secure user management, and fast UI rendering.

🧱 Tech Stack Summary
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React.js (Vite + SWC), Material UI
Backend	Express.js + Node.js
Database	MongoDB Atlas
Authentication	Firebase Auth (Google & Email/Password)
Deployment	Docker Compose (for local dev), Vercel/Render for production
State Management	React useState/useContext (can be expanded)
API Requests	Axios
Form Validation	Yup / React Hook Form (optional)

🔐 Authentication Flow (Firebase + Express)
User logs in via Firebase (Google or Email/Password)
Firebase returns a JWT (idToken)
Frontend stores this token (in localStorage)
All protected API calls send Authorization: Bearer <idToken>
Backend verifies token using Firebase Admin SDK
Middleware attaches user info (UID, email) to req.user
🔄 Data Flow
React (client)
  ↓ sends token
Express (server)
  ↓ verifies with Firebase Admin
MongoDB Atlas
  ↔ CRUD operations for users, campaigns, donations, comments
🔗 APIs (Sample)
Endpoint	Method	Purpose
/api/test	GET	Check server status
/api/users/register	POST	Store new user in DB
/api/campaigns	GET/POST	View or create campaigns
/api/donations	POST	Process donations
/api/comments/:id	GET/POST	Comment on campaign
/api/admin/complaints	GET	Admin view feedback
⚙️ Environment Management
.env file values (in env.txt) store:

MongoDB Atlas connection URI
Firebase project credentials
Frontend and backend base URLs
Port config
🐳 Docker Setup
You’ve containerized both client/ and server/ for consistent dev/testing:

📁 docker-compose.yml

Spins up React frontend and Express backend
Sets up network for communication
Uses Dockerfile in each subdirectory
✅ Ready for Extension
The current scaffold supports:

Adding role-based access (Admin/User)
Expanding MongoDB models (Campaign, Donations, Feedback)
Razorpay/Stripe integration
Monthly donation subscriptions
Admin dashboard with analytics
Notifications, social sharing, etc.
