# Campaign Lifecycle Management System

## Overview

The CrowdFundNext platform implements a comprehensive campaign lifecycle management system that automatically handles campaign status transitions, funding goals, time limits, and completion states. This system ensures campaigns are properly managed from creation to completion.

## Campaign Statuses

### 1. **Pending** (`pending`)
- **Description**: Campaign submitted and awaiting admin approval
- **Actions**: Admin can approve or reject
- **UI**: Shows warning color with timer icon
- **Donations**: Not allowed

### 2. **Active** (`approved`)
- **Description**: Campaign approved and live for donations
- **Actions**: Users can donate, like, comment, share
- **UI**: Shows success color with info icon
- **Donations**: Allowed
- **Auto-transition**: Can become `funded` when goal reached

### 3. **Funded** (`funded`)
- **Description**: Campaign reached 100% funding goal
- **Actions**: Still accepts donations (overfunding)
- **UI**: Shows success color with trophy icon, green border
- **Donations**: Still allowed
- **Auto-transition**: Becomes `completed` when time expires

### 4. **Completed** (`completed`)
- **Description**: Campaign successfully completed with funding goal met
- **Actions**: Read-only, no more donations
- **UI**: Shows success color with check icon, blue border
- **Donations**: Not allowed
- **Final State**: No further transitions

### 5. **Failed** (`failed`)

### 6. **Rejected** (`rejected`)
- **Description**: Campaign rejected by admin
- **Actions**: Creator can edit and resubmit
- **UI**: Shows error color with cancel icon

## Campaign Lifecycle Flow

```
[Creation] ‚Üí [Pending] ‚Üí [Approved] ‚Üí [Funded] ‚Üí [Completed]
                ‚Üì           ‚Üì           ‚Üì
             [Rejected]  [Failed]   [Failed]
```

### Detailed Flow:

1. **Campaign Creation**
   - User creates campaign
   - Status: `pending`
   - Admin reviews and approves/rejects

2. **Campaign Approval**
   - Admin approves campaign
   - Status: `approved`
   - Campaign becomes live for donations

3. **Funding Goal Reached**
   - When `amountReceived >= amountNeeded`
   - Status: `approved` ‚Üí `funded`
   - System adds congratulatory comment
   - Campaign continues accepting donations

4. **Campaign Completion**
   - When time limit expires AND goal reached
   - Status: `funded` ‚Üí `completed`
   - Campaign becomes read-only
   - System adds completion comment

5. **Campaign Failure**
   - When time limit expires AND goal NOT reached
   - Status: `approved`/`funded` ‚Üí `failed`
   - Campaign becomes read-only
   - System adds failure comment

## Time Limit Handling

### Fixed Time Limits
- Campaigns with specific end dates
- Automatically expire on the end date
- Status updates based on funding progress

### Flexible Time Limits
- Campaigns with maximum duration (default: 90 days)
- Automatically expire after max duration
- Status updates based on funding progress

### No Time Limits
- Campaigns without time constraints
- Only status changes based on funding progress
- Can remain active indefinitely

## Automated Status Updates

- **Every 30 minutes**: Check for expired campaigns
- **Daily (2 AM UTC)**: Maintenance and cleanup

### Real-time Updates

## System Comments

The system automatically adds comments for important events:

### Funding Success
```

```

### Campaign Completion
```
‚úÖ Campaign completed successfully! Total raised: $X (Y% of goal). Thank you to all supporters!

```
